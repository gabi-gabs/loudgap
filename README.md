## About

Loud Gap is remixed from Listen to Wikipedia, a project built by Stephen LaPorte and Mahmoud Hashemi. Listen to Wikipedia was inspired by Maximillian Laumeister's [Listen to Bitcoin](http://www.listentobitcoin.com/).


## Sounds

The samples are taken from 50 Cent's Many Men and Aretha Franklin's (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.
